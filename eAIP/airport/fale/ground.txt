<code>Springbok 78, push and start is approved, face [direction], QNH xxxx</code>

=== General Notes ===
  * Some stands, for example C2 and C5, or those on the D Apron may require bigger jets to "push and pull" appropiately onto the taxiway to ensure to avoid hitting the terminal.
  * Aircraft pushing out of A1 should be instructed to face west, regardless of Runway configuration. Outbound aircraft can then taxi out via C to the appropiate holding point.
  * Aircraft should avoid pushing onto the active taxiways.
