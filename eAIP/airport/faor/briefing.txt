===== FAOR Pilot Briefing =====

Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to FAOR should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.
Pilots who wish to find charts for O.R. Tambo, who do not have a subscription to a charts provider, can find easily accessible charts via ChartFox, linked: https://chartfox.org/FAOR

===== General Notes =====
  * During non busy times, single runway operations may be in use, which, 99.8% of the time, will be the western runway (03L/21R), check the ATIS if you are arriving and make sure you don't end up on the wrong runway!
  * Between both runways, taxiways fall under the jurisdiction of the Tower Controller. If you are an arrival and there is only Ground, don't contact until clear of the western runway (03L/21R). Aircraft spawning in these areas should still contact Ground/Delivery for clearance.

===== Stand Allocation =====

  * Johannesburg will have plenty of stands available for pilots to spawn in at, below are the stand allocation choices enforced:

  * **Domestic**
  - A11 to A13
  - C1 to C24

  * **International:** 
  - A1A, A1 to A10
  - B1 to B13
  - E1 to E13
  - F1 to F7

  * **Cargo (can also be used as extra parking spots if nessecary)**:
  - D1 to D50
  - G1 to G7


=== Pushback and Taxi ===
  * 10-15 minutes before your CTOT, call O.R. Tambo Delivery (FAOR_DEL) for push and start, who will then hand you off to the correct frequency.
  * If 03L is in use, Ground will issue you taxi to the **CAT 2** Holding Point. You must not pass this holding point until further instruction is given. They are located on B and J.
  * Thereafter, TWR or GND will issue you further taxi to hold short of 03L.
  * Expect a few minutes delay with push during busy times, as there will be planes moving in all directions across the apron, so do be patient when asking for push.
  * **Pilots should only ask for push once the pushback tug is fully connected to avoid delays.**

=== Takeoff and Departure ===

  * Intersection departures are available on request, at the discretion of the controller.
  * Pilots are expected to be fully configured and ready for departure before reaching the holding point for Runway 03L/21R. If you aren't ready, please do advise ATC at the earliest.
  * When given take off clearance, pilots should spend as little time on the runway as is needed.
  * Comply with your assigned departure procedure and do not climb above your initial Climb Altitude unless instructed so.
  * You may be given intermediate climb instructions due to traffic. Do not climb above any assigned flight level.

===== Arrival Briefing =====
=== Arrivals and Approaches ===

  * As your flight is approaching, please make yourself familiar with the arrival and approach procedures for Johannesburg.
  * From Area, pilots will only be told the landing direction, but not the specific runway of landing. For example, you will only be told "03" instead of "03L". Left or Right comes from Johannesburg Radar (FAOR_APP.)
  * **Make sure to comply with speed restrictions as published on the arrival chart at all times, unless otherwise instructed.**

=== Landing ===
  * When landings, pilots are advised to vacate as quickly as possible from 03R/21L to allow for smooth running of arrivals.
  * For 03R, we advise vacating at RE or RS.
  * For 21L, we advise vacating at RR.
  * Pilots will be given taxi by Tower to the Runway 03L, before being handed off to Ground after crossing.
